## General Information
In a typical financial based company, there will be various types of loans given to customers. However when the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide if loan can be given based on applicant's profile. If we reject the loan and if the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then there will be loss of business to the company. If the loan is approved and in case the loan is not repaid then it will be a loss for the company.

We need to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default which will help the company use this and assess the risk

## Conclusions
Based on the above graph analysis related to the charged off loans, there is more probability of defaulting on the below scenarios:
1. Loan applicants who has house ownership as RENT
2. Loan taken for Debt Consolidation. Probably to clear other debts
3. Grade of B
4. Sub Grade of B5
5. Those who are paying interest rate of 13% to 17%
6. Employment length of 10+ years
7. Who have open account of 2 - 10
8. Those who have annual income of 31k to 58k
9. Whenever the loan status is not verified
10. Loan term of 36 months
11. If there are 0 enquiries in the last 6 months
12. When public record is 0
13. When monthly installment is between 145-274
14. When DTI is between 12-18
15. Whoever has taken loan amount of 5k to 10k
16. When funded amount by investor is between 5k to 10k

Most importantly, loans taken in 2011 year and during December have more defaulting of loan. This could be because of some crisis or loss of jobs during that period which could have triggered
